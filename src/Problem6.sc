/** The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  *     1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
  *     The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  *     (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
  *     Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
  *     natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
  *     Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
  *     hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
